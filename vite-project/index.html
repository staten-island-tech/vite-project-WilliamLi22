<!-- Using ViteJS, you will scaffold a single page project that will act as a store front for a business. The site will render cards for products using forEach() and iterate over an array in your JS files. Through User Interactions the product list will change. You will use BOTH filter and map to create new arrays to iterate through and display on the screen. You will also be creating themes using CSS Custom Properties. Users will be able to change themes as desired
